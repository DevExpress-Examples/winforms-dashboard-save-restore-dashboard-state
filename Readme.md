# Dashboard for WinForms - How to Save and Restore the Dashboard State

This example demonstrates how to manage dashboard state to save and restore user selections.

![screenshot](./images/screenshot.png)

When the form closes, the [DashboardViewer.GetDashboardState](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.GetDashboardState) obtains a dashboard state object. It is serialized to XML and added to the **XElement** object stored in the [CustomProperties](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardCommon.CustomProperties) collection. Subsequently the dashboard with the dashboard state data is saved to a file.

When the application starts, the DashboardViewer control loads the dashboard and the DashboardState object is deserialized in the **GetStateFromCustomProperty** method.

The dashboard state is restored using the **GetStateFromCustomProperty** method in the [DashboardViewer.SetInitialDashboardState](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWin.DashboardViewer.SetInitialDashboardState) event handler.

You can click the **Reset Dashboard State** button to apply the [dashboard state](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardCommon.DashboardState) created at runtime.
